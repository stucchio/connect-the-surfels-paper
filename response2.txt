Response to Reviewer 4

Minor points

Abstract: Hopefully fixed.

Page 1. Reworded, and clarified that the algorithm does not know the number of curves.

Page 2. The fact that \curvesep < 1 is now stated. Removed the title from the figures 1 and 2. I did not normalize \curvemax, however.

Page 5. Figure 3. The blue region is used in the proof of lemma 2.5, and I now notre this in the caption to figure 3.

Page 6. I did not intend to imply that the crossing edges were a result of a beta-crust algorithm, merely the output of a proximity algorithm. The caption now clarifies this.

Page 7. Added step 4 to the algorithm to remove duplicates.

Page 8. It should indeed have been w'(t), now fixed. Text is somewhat updated.

Page 9. \xi is indeed measured in radians, but it is not being added to units of length in Theorem 3.2. \xi \epsilon (note: epsilon has units of length) is.

Page 10. Added the figure as suggested, it's now figure 6.

Page 13. No opinion on whether to remove/drastically cut the MRI stuff.

Page 15-16. No idea what he wants us to do.

Page 20. I don't really agree, I find the vector signs easy to ignore and useful in reading. We can change them to bold or something if that works better.

Page 22. Not sure what he is referring to here.
