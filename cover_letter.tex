  \opening{Dear Editor,}

  On behalf of myself (Chris Stucchio) and Leslie Greengard, we would like to submit the article, \emph{Curve Reconstruction from Points and Tangents}, for publication in Graphical Models. This work discusses improvements in curve reconstruction which are possible when  tangential information is available.

  We suggest as possible reviewers Nina Amenta (amenta@cs.ucdavis.edu), Tamal Dey (tamaldey@cse.ohio-state.edu) or David Eppstein (eppstein@ics.uci.edu); they have all worked on the problem of curve reconstruction.

  \closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
