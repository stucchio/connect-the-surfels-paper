Reviewer #1:

p. 1, Abstract: We have modified the abstract as per the reviewer's suggestion.

p. 4, Figure 3:

p. 6, Algorithm, line 2a: We have incorporated the suggested changes.

p. 8.

p. 13, line 1, and p. 15, line 11, both of which concerned a reference to Algorithm 4. We had actually intended these remarks to apply to Algorithm 1, the Noise-Free Polygonalization algorithm. We mistakenly assigned the same LaTeX label to Algorithm 4 as to Algorithm 1. This is now fixed.

Reviewer #2:

1. The suggested changes have now been made.

8. We are uncertain what the reviewer means by "not realistic", but we will assume for the purposes of this response that he/she means "not realistic for any imaging modalities he/she is familiar with". We recognize that our motivating application (MRI) might be unfamiliar to many readers of Graphical Models. For this reason, we have added Section 4.3.1 which explains the source of randomly located spurious surfels in the case of MRI images.
