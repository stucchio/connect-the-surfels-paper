Reviewer #1:

p. 1, Abstract: We have modified the abstract as per the reviewer's suggestion.

p. 4, Figure 3:

p. 6, Algorithm, line 2a: We have incorporated the suggested changes.

p. 8.

p. 13, line 1, and p. 15, line 11, both of which concerned a reference to Algorithm 4. We had actually intended these remarks to apply to Algorithm 1, the Noise-Free Polygonalization algorithm. We mistakenly assigned the same LaTeX label to Algorithm 4 as to Algorithm 1. This is now fixed.
